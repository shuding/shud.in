# Games I Enjoyed

10 years ago, _Braid_ was the game that got me into the world of indie games. There's a documentary called _Indie Game: The Movie_ which deeply impressed me — a college student looking for things to learn.

Since then I started to think about game as a special media for expressing rather than a tool of entertainment.

## Programming

If you like programming, logic, and challenges, there're many hidden gems.

_Recursed_ is a real masterpiece. Some simple game mechanisms bring you deep programming concepts such as callback, closure, recursion and continuation. And you solve puzzles inside it.

Of course I'm a code golf lover. There're games such as _A=B_ and _TIS-100_. _Brainfuck Challenges_ is on this list too.

## Puzzles

There're countless sokoban-like puzzle games (even I made some prototypes, too). The most hardcore one is _Stephen's Sausage Roll_, and the creator, Increpare is simply a genius. I played almost every game on his website.

## Detective 

_Return of the Obra Dinn_ is the best.

## Metroidvania

_MotionRec_ and _Öoo_ are really good. _Animal Well_ makes me want to write a physics engine.

I don't know how many hours I spent to just look at _Balatro_'s shaders and joker designs. Once upon a generation. So good.
