# Games I Enjoyed

10 years ago, _Braid_ was the game that got me into the world of indie games. There's a documentary called _Indie Game: The Movie_ which deeply impressed me — a college student looking for things to learn.

Since then, I started to think about games as a special medium for expression rather than just a tool for entertainment.

## Programming

If you like programming, logic, and challenges, there are many hidden gems.

_Recursed_ is a real masterpiece. Simple game mechanisms bring you deep programming concepts such as callbacks, closures, recursion, and continuations. And you solve puzzles with them.

Of course, I'm a code golf lover. There are games such as _A=B_ and _TIS-100_. _Brainfuck Challenges_ is on this list too.

## Puzzles

There are countless sokoban-like puzzle games (even I made some prototypes, too). _Baba is You_ shows how simple rule-based mechanics can create mind-bending puzzles — changing the rules of the game itself is the puzzle.

The most hardcore one is _Stephen's Sausage Roll_, and the creator, Increpare is simply a genius. I played almost every game on his website.

_Patrick's Parabox_ explores nested realities and recursion in such an elegant way. You literally push boxes containing the entire level you're in.

## Detective 

_Return of the Obra Dinn_ is the best.

## Metroidvania

_MotionRec_ and _Öoo_ are really good. _Animal Well_ makes me want to write a physics engine.

I don't know how many hours I spent to just look at _Balatro_'s shaders and joker designs. Once upon a generation. So good.
