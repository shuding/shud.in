_I wrote the following note when Dynamic Island came out. Til today I still think so, and the same thoughts also apply to Liquid Glass._

Dynamic Island is a clever compromise, but not good design.
I’ve been thinking about this intuition for a while, and only now have I managed to develop a more complete answer.

I’m reminded of two of Dieter Rams’ Ten Principles of Good Design, which strike at the heart of the matter:
- Good design is unobtrusive
- Good design is long-lasting

In what is clearly a compromise with physical limitations, Dynamic Island at least manages to be honest, beautiful (in a certain sense, as I’ll explain), and useful (again, in a certain sense). But it is ultimately destined not to last.

Flashy design is one of the hallmarks of this era. It reminds users of coolness, individuality, vibrancy, uniqueness. At the same time, the excessive visual effects of Dynamic Island pull my attention—whether subtly or overtly—away from the content and toward what should have remained in the background.

But is it useful? I’m not sure what problem it’s really solving. Do I need an intrusive indicator light? Or even further—do I need animations (to tell me where an app has gone)?

Apple designer Chan Karunamuni has led several major projects over the past five years, including iPhone X’s Fluid UI and now Dynamic Island. In related areas like squircles replacing rounded corners, or the iPadOS cursor animation, we can see Apple’s fondness for and pursuit of a more physically grounded UI. This has, of course, solved many problems and inspired the industry greatly. But it’s also led to a different kind of design pursuit that doesn’t necessarily lead to better outcomes.

Let me try to explain this more clearly:

Good design isn’t just about referencing the physical world or simulating it with 3D rendering. It is also a work of art. It must pursue beauty (Good design is aesthetic). And beauty can be attractive—or even ugly. But at its core, beauty requires emotion, and emotion is personal. We shouldn’t be afraid to break away from the rules of the physical world. Don’t fear icons that aren’t smooth. Don’t fear animations that aren’t perfectly fluid. Create the design that you believe is better.
I miss the reflective metal screw textures from older versions of iOS, because I could sense the taste of the person who made that design.

Another story I remembered comes from a talk by designer Jaskni:
At a time when many people were accustomed to using square (cornered) quotation marks 「」, he was no exception. One day, a friend (or maybe a colleague—I forget which) asked him why he went out of his way to emphasize the quoted content in that manner. It was then he realized that using those square quotation marks wasn’t just about standards, aesthetics, or even personal preference—it served an uncommon yet distinct visual function in that language context. It highlighted and emphasized the design itself, becoming a kind of unconscious kitsch.

I think this story comes very close to the essence of design.

Let me know if you’d like this edited into a more naturalized essay in English, or kept more literal.
