# Tim de Vries

About
I’m Tim.
A product-minded entrepreneur with a background in digital marketing, design, and building ventures from scratch.


Over the past decade, I’ve grown a digital agency to over $1M in annual revenue, led multiple SaaS product launches from zero to exit, and built teams that blend creative vision with technical execution. My work has always sat at the intersection of user experience, growth, and scalable technology.

Today, my focus is on AI - helping companies navigate the chaos and unlock real value. I’m building a top-tier collective of AI experts, designers, and engineers, working with forward-thinking teams to prototype, ship, and scale next-generation products.
